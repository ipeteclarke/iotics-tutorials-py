    "\n",
    "To start creating a DID you'll need 2 values:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A Seed, a random string of characters generated via the API.\n",
    " - A Key Name, a string of characters that uniquely identifies the entity.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "### Identity storage\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When a DID is created, it's stored into its related DDO, Decentralised Identity Document, which, along with the DID, contains some other important information for entity identification.\r\n",

    "\n",
    "### Delegation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once the DIDs are created the Delegation can take place. Delegation is the process of granting another entity the ability to act on behalf of an identity owner.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In IOTICS the delegating entity is always a User or a Twin and the delegated entity is always the Agent. With this, we have two types of delegation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " - Authentication delegation:  A User delegates authorisation to an Agent so it can authenticate itself on an IOTICSpace on behalf of such User.\r\n",
    " - Control delegation: A Twin delegates control to an Agent to grant it the ability to perform operations on behalf of such Twin.in.\r\n",
